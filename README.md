# OpenCV-Darknet-Object-Detection

## To use

- Install the required libraries using pip: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- In this script, I use my own examples. So feel free to change the weight, config and the video source. To capture from the webcam or any camera, change the video_source to '0'

- Rename your .names file into coco.names and replace the current coco file inside the directory

- To quit the session, press any key. Make sure to rescale your images as it may be too big for your screen
